:description: Detailed information about the OpenZeppelin Monitor project structure.

This document provides detailed information about each directory in the OpenZeppelin Monitor project.

== Source Code Organization

=== `src/` Directory
The main source code directory contains the core implementation files organized into several modules:

* `bootstrap/`: Application initialization and setup for `main.rs`
** Handles service initialization and dependency injection

* `models/`: Core data structures and types
** `blockchain/`: Platform-specific implementations
*** `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine specific types
*** `stellar/`: Stellar blockchain specific types
** `config/`: Configuration loading and validation
** `core/`: Core domain models

* `repositories/`: Configuration storage
** Handles loading and validating configuration files
** Provides storage interfaces for monitors, networks, and triggers
** Implements validation of configuration references

* `services/`: Core business logic
** `blockchain/`: Blockchain client interfaces
*** `transports/`: Transport clients
**** `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine transport client
**** `stellar/`: Stellar transport client
*** `clients/`: Client implementations
**** `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine client
**** `stellar/`: Stellar client
** `blockwatcher/`: Block monitoring and processing
** `filter/`: Transaction and event filtering
*** `filters/`: Filter implementations
**** `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine filter
**** `stellar/`: Stellar filter
** `notification/`: Alert handling
** `trigger/`: Trigger evaluation and execution
**** `script/`: Script execution utilities


* `utils/`: Helper functions
** `cron_utils`: Cron schedule utilities
** `expression`: Expression evaluation
** `logging/`: Logging utilities
** `metrics/`: Metrics utilities
** `monitor/`: Monitor configuration test utilities

== Configuration and Data

=== `config/` Directory
Contains JSON configuration files for:

* Network configurations (`networks/`)
** Connection details for blockchain networks
** RPC endpoints and network parameters

* Monitor configurations (`monitors/`)
** Monitoring rules and conditions
** Network and trigger references

* Trigger configurations (`triggers/`)
** Notification settings
** Script definitions

* Filter configurations (`filters/`)
** Match filter scripts

[TIP]
====
The `examples/config/` directory contains example JSON configuration files for each (network, monitor, trigger and filters).
====

=== `data/` Directory
Runtime data storage:

* Block processing state
* Operational data
* Temporary files

[NOTE]
====
The `data/`, `logs/` and `config/` directories are gitignored except for example files. These directories mounted to persist the configs and runtime data.
====

== Examples
=== `examples/` Directory
Provides practical examples and sample configurations to help users get started:

* Demonstrates typical service configurations for various networks
* Acts as a quick-start guide for customizing the monitor
* Serves as a reference for best practices in configuration

== Metrics and Monitoring

=== `cmd/prometheus/` Directory
Prometheus exporters:

* `dashboards/`: Grafana dashboards
* `datasources/`: Prometheus datasources
* `prometheus.yml`: Prometheus configuration
* `grafana.ini`: Grafana configuration

== Testing and Documentation

=== `tests/` Directory
Contains comprehensive test suites:

* Integration tests
* Property-based tests
* Mock implementations
* Test utilities and helpers

=== `docs/` Directory
Project documentation:

* User guides
* API documentation
* Configuration examples
* Architecture diagrams

=== `scripts/` Directory
Utility scripts for:

* Development workflows
* Documentation generation
* Build processes
* Deployment helpers

== Development Tools

=== Pre-commit Hooks
Located in the project root:

* Code formatting checks
* Linting rules
* Commit message validation

=== Build Configuration
Core build files:

* `Cargo.toml`: Project dependencies and metadata
* `rustfmt.toml`: Code formatting rules
* `rust-toolchain.toml`: Rust version and components

== Docker Support

The project includes Docker configurations for different environments:

* `Dockerfile.development`: Development container setup.
* `Dockerfile.production`: Production-ready container.
* Before running the docker compose set your env variables in `.env` according to your needs.

[TIP]
====
For detailed information about running the monitor in containers, see the Docker deployment section in the main documentation.
