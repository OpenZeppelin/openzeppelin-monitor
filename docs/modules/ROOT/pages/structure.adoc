:description: Detailed information about the OpenZeppelin Monitor project structure.

This document provides detailed information about each directory in the OpenZeppelin Monitor project.

== Source Code Organization:

=== `src/` Directory:
The main source code directory contains the core implementation files organized into several modules:

* `bootstrap/`: Application initialization and setup for `main.rs`
** Handles service initialization and dependency injection

* `models/`: Core data structures and types
** `blockchain/`: Platform-specific implementations
*** `evm/`: Ethereum Virtual Machine specific types
*** `stellar/`: Stellar blockchain specific types
** `config/`: Configuration loading and validation
** `core/`: Core domain models

* `repositories/`: Configuration storage
** Handles loading and validating configuration files
** Provides storage interfaces for monitors, networks, and triggers
** Implements validation of configuration references

* `services/`: Core business logic
** `blockchain/`: Blockchain client interfaces
** `blockwatcher/`: Block monitoring and processing
** `filter/`: Transaction and event filtering
** `notification/`: Alert handling
** `trigger/`: Trigger evaluation and execution

* `utils/`: Helper functions
** `cron_utils/`: Cron schedule utilities
** `expression/`: Expression evaluation

== Configuration and Data:

=== `config/` Directory:
Contains JSON configuration files for:

* Network configurations (`networks/`)
** Connection details for blockchain networks
** RPC endpoints and network parameters

* Monitor configurations (`monitors/`)
** Monitoring rules and conditions
** Network and trigger references

* Trigger configurations (`triggers/`)
** Notification settings
** Action definitions

=== `data/` Directory:
Runtime data storage:

* Block processing state
* Operational data
* Temporary files

[NOTE]
====
The `data/` and `config/` directories are gitignored except for example files. This directory is typically mounted as a Docker volume in production.
====

== Testing and Documentation:

=== `tests/` Directory:
Contains comprehensive test suites:

* Integration tests
* Property-based tests
* Mock implementations
* Test utilities and helpers

=== `docs/` Directory:
Project documentation:

* User guides
* API documentation
* Configuration examples
* Architecture diagrams

=== `scripts/` Directory:
Utility scripts for:

* Development workflows
* Documentation generation
* Build processes
* Deployment helpers

== Development Tools:

=== Pre-commit Hooks:
Located in the project root:

* Code formatting checks
* Linting rules
* Commit message validation

=== Build Configuration:
Core build files:

* `Cargo.toml`: Project dependencies and metadata
* `rustfmt.toml`: Code formatting rules
* `rust-toolchain.toml`: Rust version and components

== Docker Support:

The project includes Docker configurations for different environments:

* `Dockerfile.development`: Development container setup
* `Dockerfile.production`: Production-ready container
* Environment-specific configurations (`env_dev`, `env_prod`)

[TIP]
====
For detailed information about running the monitor in containers, see the Docker deployment section in the main documentation.
