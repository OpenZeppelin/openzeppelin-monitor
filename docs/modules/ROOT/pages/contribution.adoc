:description: Guidelines for contributing to OpenZeppelin Monitor

Welcome to the OpenZeppelin Monitor project! We appreciate your interest in contributing. This guide outlines the requirements and processes for contributing to the project.

== Getting Started

The OpenZeppelin Monitor project has comprehensive contribution guidelines documented in the link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-monitor/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[`CONTRIBUTING.md`] file and related documentation.

== Key Requirements

=== Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**You must sign the CLA before contributing.** The CLA process is automated through GitHub workflows that check and label PRs accordingly.

* All contributors must complete the CLA process
* The CLA bot will automatically check your PR status
* PRs cannot be merged without a signed CLA

=== Signed Commits

**All commits must be GPG-signed** as a security requirement.

* Configure GPG signing for your commits
* Unsigned commits will not be accepted
* This helps ensure code integrity and authenticity

== Development Workflow

=== 1. Pre-commit Hooks

**Required for code quality checks** including `rustfmt`, `clippy`, and commit message validation.

* Install and configure pre-commit hooks
* Automatic formatting and linting checks
* Commit message format validation

=== 2. Branch Management

* Create feature branches from an up-to-date main branch
* Regularly sync with upstream
* Use descriptive branch names

[source,bash]
----
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Keep branch updated
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
----

== Code Standards

=== Rust Standards

Rust API Guidelines:

* Format code with `rustfmt`
* Pass all `clippy` linting checks
* Follow Rust naming conventions

[source,bash]
----
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check linting
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run tests
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test
----

=== Testing Requirements

**All contributions must pass existing tests** and include new tests when applicable:

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Add integration tests for complex features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting
* Maintain or improve code coverage

For detailed testing information, see the xref:testing.adoc[Testing Guide].

=== Commit Message Format

**Follow conventional commit format** with types like:

* `feat:` - New features
* `fix:` - Bug fixes
* `docs:` - Documentation changes
* `test:` - Test additions or modifications
* `refactor:` - Code refactoring
* `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
