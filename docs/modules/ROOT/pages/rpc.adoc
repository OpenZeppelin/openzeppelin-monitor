:description: Documentation for the RPC client implementation and endpoint management features.


== Overview

The OpenZeppelin Monitor includes a robust RPC client implementation with automatic endpoint rotation and fallback capabilities. This ensures reliable blockchain monitoring even when individual RPC endpoints experience issues.

* Multiple RPC endpoint support with weighted load balancing
* Automatic fallback on endpoint failures
* Rate limit handling (429 responses)
* Connection health checks
* Thread-safe endpoint rotation

== Configuration

=== RPC URLs

RPC endpoints are configured in the network configuration files with weights for load balancing:

[source,json]
----
{
  "rpc_urls": [
    {
      "type_": "rpc",
      "url": "https://primary-endpoint.example.com",
      "weight": 100
    },
    {
      "type_": "rpc",
      "url": "https://backup-endpoint.example.com",
      "weight": 50
    }
  ]
}
----

[TIP]
====
For high-availability setups, configure at least 3 RPC endpoints with appropriate weights to ensure continuous operation even if multiple endpoints fail.

== Endpoint Management

The endpoint manager handles

* Initial endpoint selection based on weights
* Automatic rotation on failures
* Connection health checks
* Thread-safe endpoint updates

=== Rotation Strategy

The RPC client includes an automatic rotation strategy for handling specific types of failures:

* For 429 (Too Many Requests) responses:
** Immediately rotates to a fallback URL
** Retries the request with the new endpoint
** Continues this process until successful or all endpoints are exhausted

==== Configuration Options

The error codes that trigger RPC endpoint rotation can be customized in the `src/services/blockchain/transports/mod.rs` file.

[source,rust]
----
pub const ROTATE_ON_ERROR_CODES: [u16; 1] = [429];
----

=== Retry Strategy

Each transport client implements `reqwest-retry` middleware with exponential backoff to handle transient failures in network requests. This is implemented separately from the endpoint rotation mechanism.

* For transient HTTP errors and network failures:
** Retries up to 2 times (configurable via `ExponentialBackoff` builder)
** Applies exponential backoff between retry attempts
** Returns the final error if all retry attempts fail
** Maintains the same URL throughout the retry process
** Independent from the endpoint rotation mechanism

==== Configuration Options

The retry policy can be customized using the `ExponentialBackoff` builder in the respective transport client. The default retry policy is:

[source,rust]
----
		let retry_policy = ExponentialBackoff::builder()
			.base(2)
			.retry_bounds(Duration::from_millis(100), Duration::from_secs(4))
			.jitter(Jitter::None)
			.build_with_max_retries(2);
----

The retry policy can be customized with the following options:

[source,rust]
----
pub struct ExponentialBackoff {
    pub max_n_retries: Option<u32>,     // Maximum number of allowed retries attempts.
    pub min_retry_interval: Duration,   // Minimum waiting time between two retry attempts (it can end up being lower when using full jitter).
    pub max_retry_interval: Duration,   // Maximum waiting time between two retry attempts.
    pub jitter: Jitter,                 // How we apply jitter to the calculated backoff intervals.
    pub base: u32,                      // Base of the exponential.
}
----

The retry mechanism is implemented at two levels:

1. *Transport Level*: Each transport client maintains its own retry policy:
+
[source,rust]
----
pub struct AlloyTransportClient {
  client: Arc<RwLock<RpcClient>>,
  endpoint_manager: EndpointManager,
  retry_policy: ExponentialBackoff,
}

pub struct StellarTransportClient {
  pub client: Arc<RwLock<StellarHttpClient>>,
  endpoint_manager: EndpointManager,
  retry_policy: ExponentialBackoff,
}
----

2. *Request Level*: The `EndpointManager` applies the retry policy through middleware:
+
[source,rust]
----
let client = ClientBuilder::new(reqwest::Client::new())
    .with(RetryTransientMiddleware::new_with_policy(retry_policy))
    .build();
----

=== Implementation Details
This retry and rotation strategies ensure optimal handling of different types of failures while maintaining service availability.

== List of RPC Calls

Below is a list of RPC calls made by the monitor for each network type for each iteration of the cron schedule.
As the number of blocks being processed increases, the number of RPC calls grows, potentially leading to rate limiting issues or increased costs if not properly managed.

*EVM*

* RPC Client initialization (per active network): `net_version`
* Fetching the latest block number (per cron iteration): `eth_blockNumber`
* Fetching block data (per block): `eth_getBlockByNumber`
* Fetching transaction receipt (per transaction in block): `eth_getTransactionReceipt`

*Stellar*

* RPC Client initialization (per active network): `getNetwork`
* Fetching the latest ledger (per cron iteration): `getLatestLedger`
* Fetching ledger data (batched up to 200 in a single request): `getLedgers`
* Fetching transactions (batched up to 200 in a single request): `getTransactions`
* Fetching events (batched up to 200 in a single request): `getEvents`


== Best Practices

* Use private RPC providers when possible
* Configure multiple fallback endpoints
* Consider geographic distribution of endpoints
* Monitor endpoint reliability and adjust weights accordingly

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

* *429 Too Many Requests*: Increase the number of fallback URLs or reduce monitoring frequency
* *Connection Timeouts*: Check endpoint health and network connectivity
* *Invalid Responses*: Verify RPC endpoint compatibility with your network type

=== Logging

Enable debug logging for detailed RPC client information:

[source,bash]
----
RUST_LOG=debug
----

This will show:

* Endpoint rotations
* Connection attempts
* Request/response details
